Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)

Windows-based computers require specific configurations to support their use as Configuration Manager site system servers.

This article primarily focuses on Windows Server 2012 and later. Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2008 are supported for the distribution point site system role. For more information, see Supported operating systems for site system servers.

For some products, like Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) for the software update point, you need to refer to the product documentation to identify additional prerequisites and limitations for use. Only configurations that directly apply for use with Configuration Manager are included here.

For more information on .NET Framework, see Lifecycle FAQ - .NET Framework.

General requirements and limitations
The following requirements apply to all site system servers:

Each site system server must use a 64-bit OS. The only exception is the distribution point site system role, which you can install on some 32-bit operating systems.

Site systems aren't supported on Server Core installations of any operating system. An exception is that Server Core installations are supported for the distribution point site system role. For more information, see Supported operating systems for Configuration Manager site system servers.

After a site system server is installed, it's not supported to change:

The domain name of the domain where the site system computer is located (also called a domain rename).

The domain membership of the computer.

The name of the computer.

If you must change any of these items, first remove the site system role from the computer. Then reinstall the role after the change is complete. For changes affecting the site server, first uninstall the site. Then reinstall the site after the change is complete.

Site system roles aren't supported on an instance of a Windows Server cluster. The only exception is the site database server. For more information, see Use a SQL Server cluster for the Configuration Manager site database.

Starting in version 1810, the Configuration Manager setup process no longer blocks installation of the site server role on a computer with the Windows role for Failover Clustering. SQL Always On requires this role, so previously you couldn't colocate the site database on the site server. With this change, you can create a highly available site with fewer servers by using SQL Always On and a site server in passive mode. For more information, see High availability options.
It's not supported to change the startup type or "Log on as" settings for any Configuration Manager service. If you do, you might prevent key services from running correctly.
